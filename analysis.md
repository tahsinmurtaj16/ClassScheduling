# Introduction

The chosen algorithms are : FCFS , SJF ,and Priority scheduling .

FCFS: First come first serve (FCFS) scheduling algorithm simply schedules the jobs according to their arrival time. The job which comes first in the ready queue will get the CPU first. The lesser the arrival time of the job, the sooner will the job get the CPU. FCFS scheduling may cause the problem of starvation if the burst time of the first process is the longest among all the jobs.

SJF: SJF scheduling algorithm, schedules the processes according to their burst time.In SJF scheduling, the process with the lowest burst time, among the list of available processes in the ready queue, is going to be scheduled next.

Priority Scheduling : In Priority scheduling, there is a priority number assigned to each process. In some systems, the lower the number, the higher the priority. While, in the others, the higher the number, the higher will be the priority. The Process with the higher priority among the available processes is given the CPU.
